# facial_expression_classifyer

Building and training a model that can classify facial expressions into 7 different categories.

The main file of interest here is the model_training.ipynb
This is where a few different deep learning models are being trained, tested, and evaluated.
A few models are created, and the final, best one, is saved as tuned\_\_model.h5
face_recognizer-py can then be run to perform a live test.
(I did not write this last file, so don't ask me about it please)
